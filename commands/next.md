# TDD Next - View Next Test

You are now executing the `/next` command to view the next test in the plan.

## Your Task

1. **Read plan.md** from the repository root
2. **Find the FIRST unmarked test** (line starting with `- [ ]`)
3. **Display the test information** including:
   - The test description
   - Its position in the plan (e.g., "Test 3 of 10")
   - Number of remaining tests

## Output Format

```
📋 Next Test in Plan:

[ ] Test description here

Position: Test X of Y
Remaining: Z tests

To execute this test, use: /go
To view the full plan, use: /plan-view
```

**DO NOT execute the test** - only show information.

Read plan.md now and show me the next unmarked test.
