# Test Plan

## Instructions

This file tracks your TDD test plan following Kent Beck's principles.

- `[ ]` = Test not started
- `[x]` = Test completed
- Use `/go` to automatically execute the next unmarked test (Red → Green → Refactor cycle)
- Use `/next` to view the next test without executing
- Use `/mark` to mark the current test as done
- Use `/plan-add` to add new tests to this plan

## TDD Workflow

1. Write a failing test (Red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Commit and repeat

## Tests

### Example Tests (Delete these and add your own)

- [ ] Test 1: Example - Should validate input parameters
- [ ] Test 2: Example - Should handle empty list gracefully
- [ ] Test 3: Example - Should raise exception for invalid data
